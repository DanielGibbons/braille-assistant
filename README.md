# Braille Assistant

This repository contains the code written for my MEng project which involved the development of an Android app to optically recognise and translate braille.

### Algorithms

The algorithms developed were written in Python and are in the "Braille_Algorithm_Development/" directory

### Android App

The Android app is in the "Braille-Assistant/" directory and supports Android phones using API 23 and later.
